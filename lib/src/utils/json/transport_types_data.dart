        "Tricycle, or Pragyia as commonly called in Ghana, are a popular and inexpensive means of street transportation in Ghana. The tricycle vehicle, mostly painted in yellow color, is preferred by some over a taxi because of their comparative low fares, the ability to swerve traffic and also alight them at particular destinations where taxi fails to go."

        "All taxis have orange corners. Some are comfortable, with law-abiding drivers and air conditioning for an extra fee. Others are filthy death traps with unlicensed drivers. Use your judgment on the condition and appearance of the car and driver before using a taxi.\n\nPassing taxis that you flag on the street are referred to as \"dropping\" taxis, and they will take you directly to your destination. There are also dropping taxis that wait for passengers at various locations, but taking a parked dropping taxi is always more expensive than flagging a taxi that is driving by.\n\nWhen a taxi stops, greet him through the open car window and ask how he is doing. After a proper greeting, tell him where you are going and determine that he knows the destination. When he tells you to \"get in\", your reply should be \"How much?\"\n\nAlways negotiate with the taxi driver before you get into the taxi. Otherwise you will pay double the rate, or more. If a taxi driver believes you are a tourist, heâ€™ll automatically assume you are rich and demand a high rate, telling you of petrol prices, tax increases or some other sad story. Whatever price he quotes, offer half of that. After he is done acting insulted you can work together to find a happy medium. If you do not get a good rate, move on and hail another taxi."

        "A Troski, most usually known as trotro is a shell of a vehicle, usually a minivan, that holds 12-18 people, crammed as tightly as possible. Trotros travel every bit of road in Ghana, making them a valuable link in the transportation system for smaller town and villages. As a rule, tro tros are uncomfortable, dirty, dangerous and yet thoroughly exciting for an adventurous visitor to Ghana. This is an excellent way to rub elbows with people - literally!\n\nYou can flag down a trotro anywhere along the road, or take one from a station. Since trotros normally wait at their station until full before departing, it is sometimes difficult to find an empty seat on a passing trotro. Taking trotros from a station is best. When taking a trotro on a little traveled route, inquire the day before about the departure time. On well-traveled routes you can be assured that a trotro will be full and departing soon. Far fewer trotros run on Sundays.\n\nFares are very low and because the rates are set by the government, overcharging is not a problem on trotros. The more significant danger is traffic accidents. Trotros pose a higher probability of risk to your health than mosquito/malaria roulette does."

        "Generally buses provide the best balance of safety, expense, speed and comfort, especially when traveling between major towns. Many have air conditioning and video, but not all. Buses will charge an extra fee for luggage. You may disembark at any point along the way, but the full fare for the bus's destination will be required.\n\nThe State Transport Company (STC) has scheduled bus service that runs along nearly all paved roads in Ghana. Tickets book in advance, so buy your tickets early rather than going to the bus station expecting to be on the next departing bus. Because the air conditioned buses are more comfortable the tickets sell out faster - sometimes days in advance.\n\nVIP also operates nice buses along major routes. They have a newer fleet, more flexible schedules, and, like tro tros, will depart for their destination once the bus is full.\n\nMetro Mass is the other main carriers between cities, and they run on much more flexible schedules. These operate along major roads, but also along routes not serviced by other bus companies. These buses are slower and less expensive, but usually provide the same level of safety and comfort as STC.\n\nBecause the buses run full from their point of departure, it is very difficult to find a seat on a passing bus unless it is far from its original point of departure. STC and VIP will only pick passengers from stations, while Metro Mass will pick passengers anywhere along the route, if seats are available. This is why they are slower."
